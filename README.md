ICT E-learning Platform
Overview
The ICT E-learning Platform is a web application designed to provide a seamless and interactive learning experience. This platform allows students and instructors to create, manage, and interact with courses online. The backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, ensuring a fast, scalable, and secure system.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration for users.
Course Management: Admins and instructors can create, update, and delete courses.
Interactive Learning: Students can enroll in courses, access course materials, and track progress.
Real-Time Updates: The application is designed to provide real-time data updates for better interactivity.
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (Planned)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
MongoDB (for local development) or MongoDB Atlas (for cloud)
npm (Node package manager)
Docker (optional, for running MongoDB in a container)
Installation
Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ICT_E-learning.git
cd ICT_E-learning
Backend Setup
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Environment variables: Create a .env file in the backend folder with the following content:
env
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://admin:yourpassword@localhost:27017/ict_elearning
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Install dependencies (Once React is set up):
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Run the frontend:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Docker Setup (Optional)
If you prefer using Docker, you can run MongoDB in a container by executing:

bash
Copy code
docker run --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -d mongo
Usage
Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 for the backend API or http://localhost:3000 for the frontend (once the frontend is linked).
Use the authentication features to log in or register.
Admins and instructors can create, update, and manage courses.
Students can browse available courses, enroll, and track their progress.
Future Improvements
Frontend Development: Integrate React.js to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Course Content Management: Implement video and file upload for course content.
Real-Time Features: Add chat or messaging features between students and instructors.
Scalability: Optimize backend for better performance as user load increases.
